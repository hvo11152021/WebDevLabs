            <p>The soundtrack to pop star Son Tung's documentary has topped Vietnam's iTunes charts, entering the top 10
                in several other countries following domestic release.</p>

            <p>The "Sky Tour" track was in 83rd position on the international iTunes chart earlier this week.</p>

            <p>The original soundtrack (OST) of the document about the pop star is #5 on Itunes in the Czech Republic,
                #6 in Singapore and #10 in Australia.</p>

            <p>It features eight songs performed by Tung at live shows in Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City last year,
                and was released simultaneously with the theatrical release of the documentary on June 12.</p>

            <p>It was the most successful opening weekend ever for a musical documentary in Vietnam, collecting VND5.5
                billion ($238,700) over the three days starting Friday.</p>
