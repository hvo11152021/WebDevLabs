            <p>Organizers have decided to halt the ongoing top-tier V. League 1 starting next week, following the
                resurgence of Covid-19 transmissions.</p>

            <p>Tran Anh Tu, chairman of Vietnam Professional Football JSC (VPF), decided to suspend all matches in the
                fourth round of V. League 1 and await a new announcement from authorities.</p>

            <p>Organizers have decided to put three matches - Than Quang Ninh FC vs HCMC FC, SHB Da Nang FC vs Ha Tinh
                FC, and Hai Phong FC vs Hanoi FC - this weekend on hold since the venues and some players stem from
                localities with fresh outbreak.</p>

            <p>After 55 days of no community infections, Vietnam registered 84 local cases on Thursday and nine more on
                Friday morning, to raise the tally to 1,651.</p>
